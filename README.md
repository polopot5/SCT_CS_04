This project demonstrates a basic keylogger implementation using Python's pynput library. It captures keystrokes and writes them to a local file (key_log.txt) in real time. The code is intended for educational and ethical use only — such as understanding input event handling, file I/O, and listener patterns in Python.

Features

Captures normal and special keys (space, enter, backspace)
Stores typed text in memory before writing to file
Real-time logging to key_log.txt
Lightweight and cross-platform (Windows/Linux)
Prerequisites

Python 3.x
pynput library (pip install pynput)
Run the Script bash python keylogger.py

Output All captured keystrokes are saved to key_log.txt in the same directory.
